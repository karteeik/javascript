<!-- Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where instead of attaching event listeners to individual child elements, you attach a single event listener to their common parent. This works because of event bubbling â€” events bubble up from the target element to its ancestors. -->

<!--  Why Use Event Delegation?
Improves performance (fewer event listeners)
Works for dynamically added elements
Easier to manage listeners on a group of elements -->
