        when the web browser load an HTML document source code and creates a tree like structure is known as Document object model (DOM). this DOM tree represents the structure of the HTML document, with each html element is being a Node in the tree.

        DOM and DOM API (Application Programming Interface) is same - it's True

        The Document Object Model is An API. The DOM tree is represented structure of your HTML document, as represented by the DOM API. 

        As started, this API then gives us many methods and properties that we can use manipulate DOM tree and therefore by extension, the document.
